```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(velocyto.R)
```

```{r cars}
scs33_1 <- read.loom.matrices(file.path("data", "cellranger_hs", "SCS33-1", "velocyto", "SCS33-1.loom"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
rvelqg <- gene.relative.velocity.estimates(emat = scs33_1$spliced,
                                           nmat = scs33_1$unspliced,
                                           smat = scs33_1$ambiguous,
                                           deltaT=1,
                                           kCells = 5,
                                           fit.quantile = 0.05)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
