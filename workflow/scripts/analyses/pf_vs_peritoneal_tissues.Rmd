Here, we compared PF-derived immune system with other peritoneal organs. We searched for publicly available datasets of immune (CD45+) cells obtained from:
- stomach
- spleen
- liver
- duodenum
- jejunum
- ileum 
- ceacum: 10.1038/s41590-020-0602-z
- transverse colon: 10.1038/s41590-020-0602-z
- sigmoid colon: 10.1038/s41590-020-0602-z
- PBMCs: current study

## CD45+ pseudobulk differential expression relative to paired PBMC samples.

## Proportional abundance PF vs PBMC relative to all CD45+ cells.

We first interrogated whether the proportional abundance 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

We next investigated whether PF

## Pseudobulk differential expression of PF-derived M2 macrophages, T-regulatory relative cells relative to PBMCs monocytes and CD4 naive.
